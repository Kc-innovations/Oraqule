        <h2>History</h2>
        <p> The Nigeria Park Service, officially known as the National Park Service (NPS), is the federal agency responsible for the management and protection of Nigeria’s national parks. Its history is rooted in traditional conservation practices by indigenous communities who preserved sacred groves and protected certain species due to cultural beliefs. During the colonial era, the British administration introduced formal wildlife protection laws, beginning with the Northern Nigeria Game Preservation Law of 1916. This marked the early foundation for organized conservation in Nigeria. After independence in 1960, responsibility for wildlife management fell to regional and later state governments, with the establishment of game reserves such as Borgu, Kainji, and Yankari. However, the need for a more centralized and standardized approach to conservation became apparent, especially as Nigeria committed to global environmental agreements.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In response, the Federal Government of Nigeria established the National Park Service in 1991 through Decree 36 (now Act Cap L65 of the Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004). This decree brought several key game reserves under federal control and officially designated them as national parks. Initially, seven parks were established: Kainji Lake, Gashaka-Gumti, Chad Basin, Cross River, Okomu, Old Oyo, and Yankari (which was later transferred to Bauchi State control in 2006). Over time, the focus of the National Park Service expanded from mere wildlife protection to broader ecological conservation, environmental education, tourism promotion, and sustainable development.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Service has faced numerous challenges, including poaching, insecurity (especially in northern regions), inadequate funding, and conflicts with local communities over land use. Nevertheless, the NPS has continued to evolve by integrating modern conservation technologies such as drones and GIS, engaging in partnerships with international environmental organizations, and promoting ecotourism as a tool for economic development. Today, the Nigeria Park Service plays a crucial role in preserving the country’s rich biodiversity, protecting endangered species, and contributing to global environmental sustainability goals.</p>
